The initial redCAP database was partially coded in Danish, and some phrases were not changed to english before data was added and could therefore not be translated. Therefore, some parts of the code is in danish, but comments have been made to make the code easier to read for non-danish speakers. Should any names be unintuitive, please contact corresponding author Phillip K Sperling (phis@rn.dk) or post an issue to the repository.

The repository includes 1 document:
